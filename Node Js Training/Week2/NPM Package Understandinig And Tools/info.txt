//============================================npm Package Understanding And Tools==================================

/* Package.json And Package.lock.json */

Both package.json and package-lock.json play critical roles in managing dependencies.
You can initialize the node project by running the below command:
npm init
package.json
It is the main configuration file in a Node project which describes the project metadata, dependencies, scripts and other required configurations. It shows the packages and their versions being used in the project. It also categorises packages based on usage like dependencies for production, devDependencies for development environment.
The Role of package.json:
1. Project Configuration:
‚Ä¢	package.json serves as a manifest file for Node projects, containing metadata about the project and its dependencies.
‚Ä¢	It includes information such as the project name, version, entry point, scripts, and dependencies.
2. Dependency Management:
‚Ä¢	Dependencies are listed in the ‚Äúdependencies‚Äù section, specifying the packages required for the project to run.
‚Ä¢	Developers can use the npm install command to install dependencies listed in the package.json.
3. Version Management:
‚Ä¢	Versions of dependencies may be specified with semantic versioning (SemVer) rules in the package.json.
‚Ä¢	This file is typically committed to version control systems (e.g., Git) to share project configurations.
After initializing, your package.json will look something like this:
{
    "name": "Your project name",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Your project description",
    "main": "app.js",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    },
    "author": "Author name",
    "license": "ISC",
    "dependencies": {
        "dependency1": "^1.4.0",
        "dependency2": "^1.5.2"
    }
}
As we can see above, a package.json file contains metadata about the project and also the functional dependencies that is required by the application.
package.lock.json
the package.lock file on the other hand provides the snapshot of all the dependencies and subdependencies with exact versions. It locks the versions for the consistent project setup accross different environments.
The Role of package-lock.json:
1. Dependency Locking:
‚Ä¢	package-lock.json is an auto-generated file that provides a detailed, deterministic record of the dependency tree.
‚Ä¢	It locks down the specific versions of every installed package, preventing unintended updates.
2. Version Consistency:
‚Ä¢	This file ensures that every developer working on the project, as well as the CI/CD system, uses the exact same versions of dependencies.
‚Ä¢	Guarantees consistent builds across different environments, avoiding ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù issues.
3. Improved Installation Speed:
‚Ä¢	package-lock.json optimizes dependency installation by storing a flat node_modules structure, reducing the need for deep dependency resolution during installation.
‚Ä¢	This results in faster and more reliable installations.
Below is how a typical package-lock.json file looks:
{
    "name": "Your project name",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "lockfileVersion": 1,
    "requires": true,
    "dependencies": {
        "dependency1": {
            "version": "1.4.0",
            "resolved": 
"https://registry.npmjs.org/dependency1/-/dependency1-1.4.0.tgz",
            "integrity": 
"sha512-a+UqTh4kgZg/SlGvfbzDHpgRu7AAQOmmqRHJnxhRZICKFUT91brVhNNt58CMWU9PsBbv3PDCZUHbVxuDiH2mtA=="
        },
        "dependency2": {
            "version": "1.5.2",
            "resolved": 
"https://registry.npmjs.org/dependency2/-/dependency2-1.5.2.tgz",
            "integrity": 
"sha512-WOn21V8AhyE1QqVfPIVxe3tupJacq1xGkPTB4iagT6o+P2cAgEOOwIxMftr4+ZCTI6d551ij9j61DFr0nsP2uQ=="
        }
    }
}
package-lock.json is crucial for locking dependencies to specific versions, ensuring consistent installations across different environments. Without it, variations in installed versions may occur. This file guarantees reproducibility by specifying exact versions, preventing discrepancies. Including both package.json and package-lock.json in source control ensures that collaborators install the exact dependencies, maintaining uniformity.
Difference between package.json and package-lock.json
package.json | package.lock.json
It contains basic information about the project. | It describes the exact tree that was generated to allow subsequent installs to have the identical tree.
It is mandatory for every project. | It is automatically generated for those operations where npm modifies either node_modules tree or package.json.
It records important metadata about the project. | It allows future devs to install the same dependencies in the project.
It contains information such as name, description, author, script, and dependencies. | It contains the name, dependencies, and locked version of the project. 

Conclusion
package.json defines the project‚Äôs basic dependencies and configuration, while package-lock.json locks down the entire dependency tree to specific versions, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds. Together, they provide a robust system for managing dependencies in Node.js projects.

/* dev dependencies ANd Peer Dependencies */

Dependencies:
‚Ä¢	Dependencies are the packages that your project directly depends on to run in production.
‚Ä¢	These packages are necessary for your application to work as intended when it‚Äôs deployed or used by end-users.
‚Ä¢	Dependencies specified under the "dependencies" key are installed when someone runs npm install without the --save-dev or -D flag.
‚Ä¢	These dependencies are typically things like web frameworks, utility libraries, or other modules that your code relies on.
"dependencies": {
 "express": "^4.17.1",
 "lodash": "^4.17.21"
}
DevDependencies
‚Ä¢	DevDependencies are packages that are only needed for development and testing purposes.
‚Ä¢	These packages are not required for your application to function in production, so they are not included when your project is deployed.
‚Ä¢	DevDependencies specified under the "devDependencies" key are installed when someone runs npm install with the --save-dev or -D flag.
‚Ä¢	Examples of devDependencies are testing libraries, build tools, code linters, and other development-related utilities.
"devDependencies": {
 "jest": "^26.6.3",
 "eslint": "^7.20.0"
}
PeerDependencies
‚Ä¢	PeerDependencies are a way to specify that your package expects the consumer (the project that installs your package) to provide a specific dependency.
‚Ä¢	These dependencies are not installed by your package but are expected to be installed at the same level as your package (i.e., by the consuming project).
‚Ä¢	This is useful when your package needs to work with a specific version of another package but doesn‚Äôt want to introduce its own copy of that package.
‚Ä¢	PeerDependencies are specified under the "peerDependencies" key in your package.json.
"peerDependencies": {
 "react": "^17.0.0",
 "react-dom": "^17.0.0"
}
üü∞ In summary,
‚Ä¢	‚Äúdependencies‚Äù are essential packages for your project‚Äôs runtime.
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúdevDependencies‚Äù are packages needed during development but not for production
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúpeerDependencies‚Äù are packages your package relies on but expects the consumer to provide
